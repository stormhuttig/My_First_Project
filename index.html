<h2>Going to the Bahamas</h2>
<center><p>This summer I went to the Bahamas for a fishing trip. We had a blast, but it was a hard trip to and back. On the way there from Florida it was expected to be calm seas after we got past the gulfstream, well it wasn't. It was very choppy and we also came across a man who had a broken transum. We were gonna go help the man but another boat was closer to him. So we were back on track for the Bahamas. When we first got there it was very hot and a lot more relaxed than the US. When we went to the front desk at customer's me, my sister, and my mom didn't even have to go in. The fishing lodge we stayed at was very nice but had so many bugs it was crazy.</p></center>

<h2>Fishing in the Bahamas</h3>

<center><p>After we got there we went straight over to a diving spot that is pretty well known and but our gear on and went spearfishing we did not see anything really worth killing, but we did see a barracuda.
We then got back into the boat and headed out for some trolling and bottom fishing. We did not catch anything but some barracudas. Then me put three people on rods and trolled for some yellowtail and caught over 25. They were so good to eat since they are so fresh.</p></center>

<h2>Crossing Back</h4>

<center><p>When it came time to leave we had to cross in bad seas. The waves were 6 feet high and was like that all the way back to Florida we were happy to be okay but sad that we had to leave. We hope to go back sometime soon but a little small waves.</p></center>

<h2>Finishing</h5>

<center><p>When done fishing we have to clean the boat/ gut the fishes. The boat is easy to clean but have not to fillet the fish is not so easy, at least for me it's not easy. When we are all done we will eat the fish with a breaded and lemon seasoning and rice.</p></center>
